    """Parses key from a single sanitizer section part stack trace and stores stack trace lines.

    A sanitizer section part stack trace is a group of contiguous lines in a sanitizer section part
    that make a typical stack trace.

    Examples from sanitizer output include:
        ==5584==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

        Direct leak of 64 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
            #0 in operator new(unsigned long) (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so)
            #1 in rclcpp::NodeOptions::get_rcl_node_options() const (/ros2/rclcpp/lib/librclcpp.so)

        SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 64 byte(s) leaked in 1 allocation(s).

    This examples shows a stack trace with fifteen lines.

    After initialization, SanitizerSectionPartStackTrace includes the following data members.

    key:
        Key parsed from the first line in the stack trace that comes from ros2 code (#1 in the
        example above). Some information is masked or omitted in the key so that keys of multiple
        stack traces that are reproductions of each other are guaranteed to match.

    lines:
        The lines that make up the stack trace.
